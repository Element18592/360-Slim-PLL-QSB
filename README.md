# Slim PLL QSB

This was designed to help aid novice installers with the RGH 3 exploit (specifically the PLL point). This QSB breaks out both PLL and POST into two easy to access pads for a cleaner and easier install while adding a resistor inline for PLL. 

For R1 simply populate it with either a 3kohm resistor for Trinity motherboards or a 1kohm resistor for Corona motherboards.

PCB Thickness: 0.6mm

R1: 0603 or 0805 package
